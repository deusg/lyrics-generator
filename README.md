# Song Lyrics Generator
This Python script prompts the user to input various words to generate personalized song lyrics. The user is asked for plural nouns representing something red and something blue, a plural noun representing something they love, and a verb.

Once the inputs are provided, the script constructs a set of song lyrics incorporating the user's choices. It then prints out the customized lyrics for the user to enjoy.

This project is a fun exercise in string formatting and user interaction, allowing users to create their own unique song lyrics based on their preferences.

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to enter words representing something red, something blue, something you love, and a verb.
3. The script will generate personalized song lyrics based on your inputs and display them for you to enjoy.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the book "_Creative Coding in Python_" (Chapter 1, Page 33).
